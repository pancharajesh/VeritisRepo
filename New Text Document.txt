tell me smth abt yourself
I am a Linux UNIX admin here at ABC Financial services inc
I have been working here for over a year and a half and am currently 
approaching the end of my project
My daily tasks involve solving tickets. we are using ServiceNow for that.
after that checking for any pings on slack and we use JIRA for any requests.
With all those my tasks would be to check filesystems , 
monitor the Veritas clusters, check logs for which we use nagios, 
monitore Solaris cluster nodes for failback and failover
attend daily meetings and provide daily updates
patch, or upgrade machines if need be
we have about 400+ production solaris nodes which we are trying to upgrade from solaris 10 to 11. 
and i also work with tools like puppet, jenkins, docker
I support the puppet team with writing puppet modules and help in the CICD pipeline for automated build, release and test phases.
